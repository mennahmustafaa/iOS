struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var tapCount = 0

    var body: some View {
        Button("Tap Count: \(tapCount)") {
            self.tapCount += 1
        }
    }
}
// ContentView is a struct, which might be created as a constant. If you think back to when you learned about structs, that means it’s immutable – we can’t change its values freely.
When creating struct methods that want to change properties, we need to add the mutating keyword: mutating func doSomeWork(), for example. However, Swift doesn’t let us make mutating computed properties, which means we can’t write mutating var body: some View – it just isn’t allowed.
