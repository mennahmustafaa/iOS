struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var tapCount = 0

    var body: some View {
        Button("Tap Count: \(tapCount)") {
            self.tapCount += 1
        }
    }
}
// ContentView is a struct, which might be created as a constant. If you think back to when you learned about structs, that means it’s immutable – we can’t change its values freely.
When creating struct methods that want to change properties, we need to add the mutating keyword: mutating func doSomeWork(), for example. However, Swift doesn’t let us make mutating computed properties, which means we can’t write mutating var body: some View – it just isn’t allowed.
---------------
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var name = ""

    var body: some View {
        Form {
            TextField("Enter your name", text: $name)
            Text("Hello, world!")
        }
    }
}
//Notice how that uses name rather than $name? That’s because we don’t want a two-way binding here – we want to read the value, yes, but we don’t want to write it back somehow, because that text view won’t change.
So, when you see a dollar sign before a property name, remember that it creates a two-way binding: the value of the property is read, but also written.
